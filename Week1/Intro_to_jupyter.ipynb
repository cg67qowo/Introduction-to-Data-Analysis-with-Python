    "We will now see how a Jupyter Notebook is structured and run basic Python programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "A notebook is a series of cell, that can be *markdown* or *code*. The markdown cells (like this one) can contain text. While in this class you will mostly see text in the markdown cells, you can also display mathematical equations, images, and many other things. For the project that you will submit, I recommend using a notebook for your code, and submitting it with comments and explanations.\n",
