## Evaluation

Your performance in this course will be evaluated based on the **final assignment (group project)**:

- Project description due by **March 30, 2026**. Describe the dataset you want to use, define 2-3 research questions, and report the planned pipeline.
    - The project description is not part of the final grading, but **mandatory** if you want to submit the assignment.
- Final project: due by **May 4, 2026**. Please hand in:
    - GitHub repository with the code, **thoroughly commented**
    - A report in form of a research paper, between 3 and 6 pages.
